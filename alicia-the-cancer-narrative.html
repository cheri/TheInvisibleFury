     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"There is no homogeneous narrative that can be applied to the experience of illness.</span> The breast cancer narrative - one of enduring hope and overcoming adversity, coming out at the end a changed and better and healthier person - is one that isn't even inclusive of the community it claims to represent."</p>

    <p class="quote">"It's also a very linear narrative that doesn't reflect what I see in my life or my cancer communities (both the ovarian cancer community and the young adult community). <span style="font-size:45px;">It doesn't take into account the branching and looping back.</span></p>

     <p class="quote">It isn't as simple as having a beginning, middle, and end - it returns on us physically and emotionally. As a dominant narrative, it silences those who don't recognize their own story in it and who feel too alone or isolated to challenge it."<p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">I like people and good writing and straight talk.</span> I have a hard time feeling sorry for people, including myself, but the people that I love, I love passionately; one may even say creepily. I try to keep that mostly to myself. <span style="font-size:45px;">I'd like to be charming, but I'm usually just a mess. I'm like a gull slamming into your windshield."</span></p>
