    		<p style="font-size:23px;font-family:Arial"><b>Overview</b></p><p><i>The Invisible Fury</i> is an interactive documentary that examines the effects of the “battle” language associated with cancer care. The aim of the documentary is to provide a centralized database that contains personal accounts of people’s experiences with cancer and its associated infrastructures.</p>
            <p><a href="2-intro-video.html">Rewatch the video introduction.</a></p><br>
            <p style="font-size:23px;font-family:Arial"><b>Our Intention</b></p><p>The project scope is to unpack the battle rhetoric associated with cancer. The rhetoric of “invasion,” “cancer battle” and “survivorship” have negative psychological and emotional consequences for patients. This aggressive language victimizes and compounds the challenges of those facing cancer or those that have gone through cancer and “lost.” The project aim is to unpack these consequences of the warfare language through two discursive categories of “Fury” and “Invisibility.” The “Fury” corresponds to topics of cellular multiplication and bodily manipulation. The “Invisibility” corresponds to issues of the confounding nature of cancer and its associated paradoxes of research, prevention, and treatment.  Sub-items of invisibility also include the very active online support communities that are created by anonymous users.<p>
            <p>The implications of this project are to give space to more cancer retrospectives that are not anonymous and to contest the “battle” language. This project further contributes to research in public education of how cancer operates socially. The Invisible Fury Project also contributes to research in the digital arts in creating a curated platform for illness narratives.</p>	
            <p style="font-size:23px;font-family:Arial"><b>Influences, Support and Resources</b></p><p>The Anti Cancer Survival Kit is a project developed collaboratively with  recently deceased Beatriz da Costa, Robert Nideffer, Pamela Jane Mendoza, Johnny Lu, Frank Peter, Jamie Schulte, and Donald Daedalus. The Kit is designed for, in Beatriz’s words, “people living with cancer, their family and friends, and those who never wish to get cancer in the first place.”  The Kit seeks to expose hidden relationships between human subjects and the “medical industrial complex.” Beatriz began compiling a database of scientific research during her own personal struggle with cancer.  She observed that significant funding for cancer research focuses on “early detection,” almost none on cancer prevention. </p>

            <p>As Beatriz stated herself (from <a href="http://crysmoore.com/acsk/">Crys Moore</a>):</p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px"><i>Environmental conditions such as exposure to carcinogens and lifestyle are the leading factors in cancer development, yet very little is being done to change these conditions. Public education is practically non-existent on these issues, forcing citizens to protect themselves, and to resist societal pressures that lead towards unhealthy lifestyles.This impulse is at the crux of the Anti Cancer Survival Kit, understanding how cancer operates scientifically, socially, and how these discourses intersect in personal experience.</i></p>
