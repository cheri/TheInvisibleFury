    		<p style="font-size:23px;font-family:Arial"><b>Overview</b></p><p>The Invisible Fury is a digital interface comprised of stories from people that have experienced cancer. Using collected video, archival material from the 1900’s, conversations from digital forums, and found footage, the Invisible Fury project is presented in the form of an interactive documentary.</p>

            <p style="font-size:23px;font-family:Arial"><b>Our Intention</b></p><p>The project scope is to unpack the battle rhetoric associated with cancer. The rhetoric of “invasion,” “cancer battle” and “survivorship” have negative psychological and emotional consequences for patients. This aggressive language victimizes and compounds the challenges of those facing cancer or those that have gone through cancer and “lost.” The project aim is to unpack these consequences of the warfare language through two discursive categories of “Fury” and “Invisibility.” The “Fury” corresponds to topics of cellular multiplication and bodily manipulation. The “Invisibility” corresponds to issues of the confounding nature of cancer and its associated paradoxes of research, prevention, and treatment.  Sub-items of invisibility also include the very active online support communities that are created by anonymous users.<p>
            <p>The implications of this project are to give space to more cancer retrospectives that are not anonymous and to contest the “battle” language. This project further contributes to research in public education of how cancer operates socially. The Invisible Fury Project also contributes to research in the digital arts in creating a curated platform for illness narratives.</p>
