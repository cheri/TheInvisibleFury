     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"In reality I was trying to scare myself.</span> I wanted to see if I could handle the worst; if I could, I would be ready. <span style="font-size:45px;">My reaction to those images would be my litmus test.</span>  Some of the pictures were horrific. I sat transfixed. I looked. I sobbed. <span style="font-size:45px;">I saw scarred, bizarre, transformed bodies</span> and couldn't believe that was going to be my body<span style="font-size:45px;">...other women must do this. Other women must have made this mistake."</span></p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"...Here I sit, two gel-filled silicone shells</span> inside my body simulating the biologically feminine body parts I should have. And sometimes that thought is disturbing.  To be clear: I don't regret having them put in.</span> I've never regretted that. It was a decision I made, and made deliberately. <span style="font-size:45px;">I knew that reconstructing my breasts was the right decision for me.</span> I am overwhelmingly happy with the cosmetic appearance and the wonderful job my talented surgeon did. <span style="font-size:45px;">I will always be grateful to him for what he's done."</p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"I definitely don't remember what my breasts looked like before.</span> I only remember these.  I once asked my plastic surgeon to see my 'before' pictures a year or two after my reconstruction was over. You know what? <span style="font-size:45px;">My 'before' breasts didn't look so great.  In my mind they did though.</span>  In my mind, everything about my life before cancer was better.  But that's not the truth. <span style="font-size:45px;">Don't take that as an endorsement of the 'cancer is a gift' nonsense though."</span></p>

Then forgets it.  With time, I can get used to a new self. <span style="font-size:45px;">It's like catching my reflection in the mirror:</span> only lately do I recognize the person staring back at me. <span style="font-size:45px;">For over a year the new hair threw me.</span> It's darker than I remember it being before it fell out. It's shorter than it was before, too.  And the look in my eyes? That's different also. <span style="font-size:45px;">I just don't recognize myself some days.</span>  Sounds like a clich&eacute; if you haven't lived it. But it's true."</p>

    <p class="quote">"My parents' careers have indelibly shaped my insights. My father, a (retired) heart surgeon, gave me a shrewd eye for detail and an aptitude for processing medical information. My mother, a (retired) psychologist specializing in grief, loss, death, and dying, shared insight into the mind of the bereaved family member."</p>

    	"My own academic background includes a graduate degree in sociology. Combining medical, psychological, and sociological sensibilities has resulted in a unique way of experiencing and describing cancer and other traumatic life experiences.  I am pleased so many people have connected to the emotions I try to capture in my writing. I hope you will too."
