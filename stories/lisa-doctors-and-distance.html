     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"When I went to see my medical oncologist at Sloan Kettering, this week she pulled the chair over and sat only inches from me.</span> I was on the exam table, in the modest red and peach Seersucker bathrobe Sloan uses for their exam gowns. We sat and talked about research and trials and side effects and my blog and my family. <span style="font-size:45px;">She gets emotional sometimes when we talk about the current situation. So do I."</span></p>

	<p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"Then Dr. Chau Dang said something that I will always remember.</span> She said that many doctors start to distance themselves from their patients as the patients get <span style="font-size:45px;">sicker and closer to death.</span> She said this is their coping mechanism. Of course I couldn't help but wonder if the same process is what is behind some of <span style="font-size:45px;">my friends disappearing</span> and rarely contacting me anymore. Some physicians, she said, seem to back away, <span style="font-size:45px;">needing emotional distance</span> not to be weakened each and every time a patient dies."</p>

    <p class="quote">"In contrast, my doctor feels this is precisely the time in her relationship with her patients to <span style="font-size:45px;">embrace them, bring them close,</span> provide them care and comfort as much as possible. It's important to remember, she always says, that this isn't a case, <span style="font-size:45px;">this is a life.</span> A person with friends and families who love them. Death happens for all of us. It's her role to do what she can to prolong life, and when that can't be done anymore, <span style="font-size:45px;">it's important to still care for the person, not just treat the disease."</span></p>

    <p class="quote">"My parents' careers have indelibly shaped my insights. My father, a (retired) heart surgeon, gave me a shrewd eye for detail and an aptitude for processing medical information. My mother, a (retired) psychologist specializing in grief, loss, death, and dying, shared insight into the mind of the bereaved family member."</p>

    	"My own academic background includes a graduate degree in sociology. Combining medical, psychological, and sociological sensibilities has resulted in a unique way of experiencing and describing cancer and other traumatic life experiences.  I am pleased so many people have connected to the emotions I try to capture in my writing. I hope you will too."
