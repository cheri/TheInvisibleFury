     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"The other day, Dr. Sugarbaker's wife and human being extraordinaire,</span> Ilse Sugarbaker, sent me a little something. Something that I'd been asking for for a couple of months.  <span style="font-size:45px;">Pictures.</span> Pictures that Dr. Sugarbaker took during my 'pick it out/pour it in' procedure. Ilse said that, in the last three years or so, not a single patient had requested intra-op photos. You know me, though. Of course I wanted to see them. <span style="font-size:45px;">All the blood and guts and cancer.</span> All that GRAPHIC stuff."</p>

	<p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"The first is a far away shot</span> of my abdominal cavity (my legs, chest, and head are covered), opened up to the world. The second and third pictures are of <span style="font-size:45px;">my dearly departed body parts: the fallen soldiers who had gotten way too close to comfort with 'the cancer.'</span>  The fourth picture captures the dead cancer. Part black and part white and bubbly. <span style="font-size:45px;">All dead and glorious.</span> The fifth picture is my abdominal cavity again, but this time all cleaned and stitched up."</p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"Seeing myself in this way</span> was a thoroughly positive experience. It filled me with gratitude for Dr. Sugarbaker and his team, for Dr. Lenz and his team, and for Dr. Ramos and his team. <span style="font-size:45px;">I like to give them all a hard time, but my doctors are the best</span> -- the best physicians and the best people. Last September, I was really sick. Like, really sick. <span style="font-size:45px;">And these guys changed all that for me.</span> Gratitude can't even begin to describe what I feel for my doctors."</p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"Looking at the pictures also filled me with pride.</span> I've gone through a lot since last September, and I endured each challenge with toughness and positivity. <span style="font-size:45px;">I never let weak thoughts invade my mind,</span> and I never let 'the cancer' get the upper hand. I never stopped believing in myself."</span></p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"Seeing my own body during that operation</span> -- one of the most invasive and aggressive surgeries around -- just proved to me that, <span style="font-size:45px;">yes, I can survive and thrive</span> through just about anything.  The pictures symbolize what this whole cancer adventure has been to me: challenging, bloody, tough to look at, but incredibly satisfying and even inspiring.  <span style="font-size:45px;">I bet you still don't want to see 'em. :)"</span></p>
