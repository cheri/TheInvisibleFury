     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"I get asked a lot about health insurance claims.</span> Having had many different diagnoses, surgeries, and procedures I have became all too familiar with interacting with insurance companies. <span style="font-size:45px;">In the last few years my diagnosis of breast cancer</span> and the almost simultaneous diagnosis of our son Tristan with congenital spine and hand abnormalities has meant a level of <span style="font-size:45px;">paperwork, claims, and appeals I could never have imagined."</span></p>

	<p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"Don't take 'no' for an answer.</span>  The fact your claim was denied is the starting point not the ending point. <span style="font-size:45px;">Insurance companies count on the fact</span> that a large percentage of subscribers will receive a denial and either 1) forget about it, 2) intend to file an appeal but <span style="font-size:45px;">not follow through,</span> or 3) incorrectly file the appeal paperwork. In any case, if they send you a claim denial and <span style="font-size:45px;">you don't follow up for any reason, they win."</span></p>

    <p class="quote">"I should point out that <span style="font-size:45px;">a doctor's office may tell you that you will have to pay out-of-pocket.</span> They may tell you that they have tried to get your service covered, it was denied and therefore this is the last word. <span style="font-size:45px;">It's not.</span> For example, my neurologist's office tried to get my Botox injections covered. Their office appealed the first rejection. They were again denied. <span style="font-size:45px;">They told me that there was 'nothing else they could do';</span> I would have to pay. Undeterred, I asked for copies of my medical records. I called my insurance company and asked what I needed to do. Despite what the doctor's office told me, I learned that <span style="font-size:45px;">patients often have a separate appeals process available to them."</span></p>

    <p class="quote">"No matter what drug, service, surgery, or treatment you are appealing, you must <span style="font-size:45px;">be organized, take notes, and document everything.</span> The key to my system is my medical binder. Have one for each family member. <span style="font-size:45px;">Save letters that were successful;</span> if you need to repeat an appeal annually (like my migraine drugs and Tristan's PT visits) then you will have a document that just needs minor tweaking.
<span style="font-size:45px;">Take notes on conversations</span> (including dates and full name of the person you spoke with) at the company or doctor's office. <span style="font-size:45px;">I learned that tip from my grandfather,</span> a court stenographer for over 50 years: always keep track of the date, time, and name of the person you talked with. <span style="font-size:45px;">It may not be enough to prove your case,</span> but if you can say 'I spoke with (first and last name) on (date)' it lends credence to the fact that conversation took place.

    <p class="quote">"My parents' careers have indelibly shaped my insights. My father, a (retired) heart surgeon, gave me a shrewd eye for detail and an aptitude for processing medical information. My mother, a (retired) psychologist specializing in grief, loss, death, and dying, shared insight into the mind of the bereaved family member."</p>

    	"My own academic background includes a graduate degree in sociology. Combining medical, psychological, and sociological sensibilities has resulted in a unique way of experiencing and describing cancer and other traumatic life experiences.  I am pleased so many people have connected to the emotions I try to capture in my writing. I hope you will too."
