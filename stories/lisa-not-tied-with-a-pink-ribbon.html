     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"I wish I had the energy of my youth.</span>
I wish I had the body.
I wish I had the fearlessness, the spunk, the drive.
I wish I could have a conversation with that young girl,
bright-eyed and full of wonder.
I wish I could tell her what lay ahead.
I wish I could tell her to gather strength, and wisdom, and patience like a squirrel gathering acorns for the winter."</p>

	<p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"But I can't go back to that time,
I can't go back to that place.</span>
I can't rewrite what's happened,
I can't do it all again.
My first diagnosis with breast cancer took its toll on me and I was quite sure I would never, ever be the same.
I had no way to know then that 'never, ever the same' would mean something worse, something fateful, a juggernaut.
I told myself 'they're only breasts.'
I said, 'I don't need ovaries, I'm done having children.'
But that obscured the truth.
The truth is that it did matter,
they do matter."</p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"They said my uterus was atrophied.</span>
It almost sounded funny when they said it.
'Who cares? What does that matter?' 
<span style="font-size:45px;">It did. It does. It will.</span>
At the time, to get rid of all hormones was thought to give me a better chance at avoiding a recurrence, but there was a price to be paid.
No estrogen mattered more than I ever thought it could.
It felt worse than taking injections to suppress my ovaries, worse than taking Tamoxifen.
Those were easy.
I had no clue what was ahead.
<span style="font-size:45px;">I wore the skirt, I put the makeup on, I walked the walk.</span>
But I did not feel like a woman anymore.
I most certainly do not feel like much of one now.
Make no mistake, I am proud of what this body has done for me.
My three children top the list.
But now I must focus on some of its cells,
now malignant,
throughout this body,
growing at a horrific pace.
<span style="font-size:45px;">My body has now become a personal science experiment."</span></p>

	You see,
	beneath the pretty lies ugly, the ugly truth of cancer and what it has taken from me.
	While some may be able to go on,
	move on,
	forget,
	I cannot.
	My body will not let me.
	<span style="font-size:45px;">These things are not tied with a pink ribbon.</span>
	These things last longer than a month.
	This is part of awareness.
	This is just a part of what breast cancer can do.
	This is just a part of what breast cancer has done to me."<p>

	This is what can happen even years later.

	This is why you are not necessarily safe.
	This is what breast cancer could do to you.
	This is how what some think they have 'beaten' or 'bid goodbye to' can still
	kill.This is what it will do to me."<p>

    <p class="quote">"My parents' careers have indelibly shaped my insights. My father, a (retired) heart surgeon, gave me a shrewd eye for detail and an aptitude for processing medical information. My mother, a (retired) psychologist specializing in grief, loss, death, and dying, shared insight into the mind of the bereaved family member."</p>

    	"My own academic background includes a graduate degree in sociology. Combining medical, psychological, and sociological sensibilities has resulted in a unique way of experiencing and describing cancer and other traumatic life experiences.  I am pleased so many people have connected to the emotions I try to capture in my writing. I hope you will too."
