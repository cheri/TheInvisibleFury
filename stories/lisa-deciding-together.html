     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"Everything changes with a diagnosis of Stage 4 cancer.</span>  Immediately after I was diagnosed in October with stage IV my oncologists began talking about finding a balance between length of life and quality of life.  For many people <span style="font-size:45px;">it is often reassuring to hear there is a plan, a prescribed protocol.</span> There is a type of comfort in being diagnosed with a disease and being told there are defined steps you need to take. With metastatic cancer it's not crystal clear. <span style="font-size:45px;">Patients must often help decide what is right for them."</span></p>

	<p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"The nature of the doctor-patient relationship changes over the course of illness.</span> Perhaps nowhere is that truer than in oncology. I've always been a partner in my care, <span style="font-size:45px;">it's the only way I know how to be.</span> It's my life, after all, and the decisions we make as a team are ones I do not want to regret because I gave up control or didn't have adequate information. However, I also accept that <span style="font-size:45px;">treating cancer is not an exact science."</span></p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"Some patients do not want to have options.</span> They want their physician to pick the course of treatment that seems best matched for the patient and proceed. A patient sometimes doesn't want choices; he or she wants the doctor to do the sifting and prescribing. <span style="font-size:45px;">This works for many people, and takes the responsibility off the patient.</span> There is mental comfort in that approach, too. I can understand why some people make that choice."</p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"One of the things that is difficult</span> in being a true participant in your own care is that while you get the satisfaction of partial control, you also must accept responsibility if/when things go wrong. <span style="font-size:45px;">This is part of the deal.</span>  Some things just are.  Some things just happen, even when you do all you can.  I have accepted this jagged truth all along.  <span style="font-size:45px;">But I think some people never do."</span></p>

    <p class="quote">"My parents' careers have indelibly shaped my insights. My father, a (retired) heart surgeon, gave me a shrewd eye for detail and an aptitude for processing medical information. My mother, a (retired) psychologist specializing in grief, loss, death, and dying, shared insight into the mind of the bereaved family member."</p>

    	"My own academic background includes a graduate degree in sociology. Combining medical, psychological, and sociological sensibilities has resulted in a unique way of experiencing and describing cancer and other traumatic life experiences.  I am pleased so many people have connected to the emotions I try to capture in my writing. I hope you will too."
