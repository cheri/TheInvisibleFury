	<p class="quote">"I woke up this morning with a shot of adrenaline. Honestly, this feels like my first round. <span style="font-size:45px;">I've been bouncing around the house, bellowing and singing</span> and generally acting like a lunatic, which is always a good sign. More than anything, I'm grateful to be alive and strong. I'm grateful that, throughout over two and a half years of treatment, <span style="font-size:45px;">I've never wavered in my approach to fighting cancer.</span> I'm grateful that my positive attitude and unyielding confidence have anchored me through every round of chemo, every round of radiation, and through every surgery."</p>

    <p class="quote">"So, now, it's time for me to hop in the shower, get my game face on, and beat cancer with chemo for the 50th time. <span style="font-size:45px;">My golden anniversary, and I'm feeling extra special golden today.</span> Thank you all for your support and love. You all make me stronger, which is pretty damn strong."</p>
