     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"I didn't expect to be here again.</span> I'm trying to figure out where to go from there, from 'I didn't expect to be here again' but I'm lost. So let's start with what I know. I'm 30-years-old and I have cancer for the second time. <span style="font-size:45px;">Though that isn't quite the truth, either.</span> It's probably more correct to say I still have cancer, but it was hiding for seven years. So this is still the first time. But it's a surprise because I didn't consider cancer to be a prominent plot point in my current life. <span style="font-size:45px;">And yet, here we are."</span></p>

	<p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"Yes, I had cancer before this.</span> I found out when I was 22, specifically a month before my 23rd birthday. It was ovarian cancer. <span style="font-size:45px;">Yes, I was very young to have ovarian cancer.</span> I am well aware of this fact, yet it is the one people most like to point out to me. Even medical professionals. <span style="font-size:45px;">Basically, I am a special snowflake.</span> A snowflake that had her ovaries, uterus, cervix, and appendix taken out, to then have her remaining body parts pumped full of drugs made from metal and trees."</p>

    <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"It can come back in other places.</span> Right now, it appears to be in the lining of my abdomen. <span style="font-size:45px;">The peritoneal lining.</span> The cells there are similar to the cells involved in my ovarian cancer. <span style="font-size:45px;">So far I believe I am lucky,</span> the cancer does not appear to be in my lymph nodes or any major organs, so while it is recurrent, it is not metastatic recurrent. <span style="font-size:45px;">If you're interested in the difference, you can Google it."</span></p>

    <p class="quote">"I like people and good writing and straight talk. I have a hard time feeling sorry for people, including myself, but the people that I love, I love passionately; one may even say creepily. I try to keep that mostly to myself. I'd like to be charming, but I'm usually just a mess. I'm like a gull slamming into your windshield."</p>
