     <p class="quote"><span style="font-size:45px;">"The bond between doctor and patient</span> -- especially if that patient is battling cancer -- is one of those make or break relationships. <span style="font-size:45px;">This isn't like your dentist</span> that you see once a year, or a doctor you check in with when you need a prescription for something. <span style="font-size:45px;">This is a person you see all the time</span> -- for treatment, for check-ups, for discussions about scan results."</p>

You inspire me every day."</span></p>
