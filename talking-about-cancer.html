What Gloria accomplished while here on earth was truly astonishing. Her inner beauty shined like a blazing sunrise, her energy soared, and her determination and competitive spirit fiercely roared. As her mother, I had the VIP seats for it all.</p><p>One year after her diagnosis, Gloria launched The WunderGlo Foundation to seek to empower and inspire those fighting the disease, demystify the colon cancer diagnosis, and support research to eradicate it. In early 2013, Gloria launched the foundation&rsquo;s most ambitious capital campaign called The Wunder Project. So proud of this revolutionary and cutting edge approach to fund the &quot;cure&quot; for colon cancer, Gloria worked tirelessly to bring widespread attention and infectious interest in this realistic and groundbreaking goal toward the cure. </p><p>Despite the fact that 2013 presented great physical challenges for Gloria, she never stopped running her foundation and running it with fervor. Gloria&rsquo;s important work included traveling around the country to spread the word about the revolutionary Wunder Project campaign, which gained widespread media attention, furthering her own cancer knowledge and education by attending and participating at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conferences both in San Francisco and in Chicago, Illinois, delivering many inspirational speeches at speaking engagements across the country. And, of course, no matter how busy Gloria was she always reserved time to reach out and counsel newly diagnosed cancer patients and their caregivers in their darkest days and shining her guiding light to inspire them to fight the battle of their lives.</p>$$Gloria Post2'},

I like people and good writing and straight talk. I have a hard time feeling sorry for people, including myself, but the people that I love, I love passionately; one may even say creepily. I try to keep that mostly to myself. I&rsquo;d like to be charming, but I&rsquo;m usually just a mess. I&rsquo;m like a gull slamming into your windshield.&quot;', posts: '&quot;The problem with that is that there is no homogeneous narrative that can be applied to the experience of illness. The breast cancer narrative - one of enduring hope and overcoming adversity, coming out at the end a changed and better and healthier person - is one that isn&rsquo;t even inclusive of the community it claims to represent. Those women who die or whose disease comes back aren&rsquo;t included. And that narrative has no place for those who don&rsquo;t find the experience transformative in a positive way.&quot;$$&quot;It&rsquo;s also a very linear narrative that doesn&rsquo;t reflect what I see in my life or my cancer communities (both the ovarian cancer community and the young adult community). It doesn&rsquo;t take into account the branching and looping back. That it isn&rsquo;t a simple as having a beginning, middle, and end - it returns on us physically and emotionally. As a dominant narrative, it silences those who don&rsquo;t recognize their own story in it and who feel too alone or isolated to challenge it.&quot;'},
